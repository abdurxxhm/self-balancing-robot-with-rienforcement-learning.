# self-balancing-robot-with-rienforcement-learning.
This repository contains the code for a self-balancing robot that uses reinforcement learning to balance itself. The robot is built using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and an MPU-6050 sensor. The robot is trained using the PPO algorithm from the stable_baselines3 library. The robot can balance itself on two wheels and move forward and backward
